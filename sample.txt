six things:
1)remove additional context from supabase and files
2)put status in history page
3)fix location shows description in history page
4)remove photo url from history page
5)put hello user in left side drawer instead of Resq Menu text
6)right now the pwa isnt available offline. it says offline. pls use service worker to cache so that report can be sent even when offline and when connection restores it will actually be stored. so cache all pwa
